# The Expanse - Interfaces

I've decided to re-create some of the HUDs, UIs, etc. from the TV show "The Expanse".

For now, there is no real way to navigate the screens.  Just go to `src/index.js` and look at the react router paths and navigate there once you've spun of the react app.

## To run:

1. Clone the repository
2. In the root directory (where `package.json` is), in a terminal or command prompt type:

```
$ npm install
```

3. Once that completes, type:

```
$ npm start
```
